# BPCS-Python
BPCS implemented in Python. Easier to use cross-platform compared to [ my previous implementation in C](https://github.com/porygon-tech/Bit-Plane-Complexity-Segmentation "papillita"). Comes with a tiny AES-256-GCM password-based authenticated encryption :)
Again, the meat is obfuscated.
